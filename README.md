This is the project of an online e-commerce online store.
The first part (commits before 6/4/23) was made using TailwindCSS, fetching data from fakestoreapi. React icons were also tried out here for the first time. It has dymanic layout, created with react router dom components.
This online store is being edited, so multiple features are to be added yet in the future (shopping cart, login page etc).
